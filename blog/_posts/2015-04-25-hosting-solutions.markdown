description: This is a useful catalog of all sorts of hosting solutions - physical, virtual and homegrown.
---

If you are planning on making a website, the first decision you need to
make is how to host your website. Do you use a VPS? Do you use a full
metal server? Do you learn NGINX and Apache and do it yourself? What
about scaling? What about storage? What about the cloud? *There are lots
of quetions to answer and I’ll try to answer them*.

Also I made a very informative table of some current good web hosting
solutions.

Basics
======

**A web host** allows your web application to be accessible to the world
wide web. This typically involves a server being somewhere that will 
receive requests and send back the information to the client. How do you
find such a server?

There are lots of companies that will sell you a server or a piece of a
server to host your web page. There are a couple of different types.

Full computer solutions
-----------------------

Full computer solutions are servers that are blank slates in the sense
that they are just computers running Linux or similar. For these you’ll
need to configure the server software (NGINX or Apache). This is easy to
do. These are full computer solutions, which can be nice if you want to
take advantage of other computer programs or system tools (like CRON).

-   **Physical Servers**: These are physical computers that a company
    will sell you. The nice thing about these is that they are housed in
    the company’s building so you don’t have to worry about electricity
    and heat issues and you also get full access to a real computer.
-   **Virtual private servers**: These are the same as physical servers,
    except that the computer that you access is contained within a
    *virtual environment*. Usually this doesn’t matter, but can
    sometimes mean that you have to share resources with somebody.
-   **Homegrown server**: This is the same as above too, except that you
    have to buy it, put it in your house, forward the ports and pay for
    the electricity.

Per diem services
-----------------

If you don’t want to setup any server stuff, and you want a more
plug-and-play type server, there are per-diem services out there. These
are like OpenShift and Amazon EC2 which allow you to pay (sometimes
free) to access there server. All you need to do is “deploy” your code.
