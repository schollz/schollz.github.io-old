Bulk experiments show that Luciferase refolding requires the aids of chaperone proteins. We find that single-molecule experiments show that partially unfolded Luciferase can refold without chaperones but chaperones are required for refolding from complete denaturation. Our results indicate that the N-terminal domain of Luciferase serves to chaperone refolding and chaperones may serve to emulate this effect. This is important since the understanding protein folding can be used to develop new therapeutics to target intermediates.
